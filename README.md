# Future-proofing the backoffice Part 2: Define the extension API

## Discussion Board

As part of defining the extension API for the new backoffice, we have created this new repository with a [discussion board](https://github.com/umbraco/DefineBackofficeExtensionAPI/discussions). Feel free to share all your ideas and thoughts about the new extension API there. It will be open to everyone to follow and participate in the discussion. At the moment the repository will only be used for its discussion area.


## Share your hack
We would love to see a lot of examples of your creative backoffice extensions. Everything from property editors, custom sections, new buttons, overlays, etc. When you share your extension please include:

1. How your extension works
2. How you have developed it
3. How you think a solution with a better extension API should look

Find the format you think tells your story the best way: video, blog posts, code pens, gists, repositories, or whatever works best for you. We would love it if you share your hack on the [discussion board](https://github.com/umbraco/DefineBackofficeExtensionAPI/discussions) of this repository, so it can contribute to the overall discussion and might spark ideas in other community members. We also fully understand if you are not able to share it in public so feel free to send your extension/story/hack to backoffice@umbraco.com
