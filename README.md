# Future-proofing the backoffice Part 2: Define the extension API - Share Your Hack

As part of defining the extension API for the new backoffice we would love to see a lot of examples of your creative backoffice extensions. Everything from property editors, custom sections, new buttons, overlays, etc. When you share your extension we would love to see:

1. How your extension works
2. How you have developed it
3. How you think a solution with a better extension API should look

Find the format you think tells your story the best way: video, blog posts, code pens, gists, repositories, or whatever works best for you. We would love it if you share your hack on the [discussion board](https://github.com/umbraco/BackofficeExtensionAPI.ShareYourHack/discussions) of this repository, so it can contribute to the overall discussion and might spark ideas in other community members. We also fully understand if you are not able to share it in public so feel free to send your extension/story/hack to backoffice@umbraco.com
